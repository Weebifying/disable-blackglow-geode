# No Force Glow

This is where she makes a mod.

Disable the forced glow on the player when the primary color in use is black

## For now it only works ingame!! (in playing level or playtesting editor)

## Potentially incompatible mods:
- rooot's Custom Gamemode Colors
- TheSillyDoggo's QOLMod (icon effects section)
- Terma's Ambient Icons (idk i havent actually tested lol)

# Special thanks to:
- [Erymanthus](https://github.com/RayDeeUx), for testing this mod on MacOS!
